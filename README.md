## News

Keiko Project is moving from CLA to DCO as a simpler way to track contributions.
* https://github.com/apps/dco/

Please start signing off your contributions by doing ONE of the following:
* Use `git commit -s ...` with each commit to add the signoff or
* Manually add a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>` to each commit message.

The email address must match your primary GitHub email. You do NOT need cryptographic (e.g. gpg) signing.
* Use `git commit -s --amend ...` to add a signoff to the latest commit, if you forgot.

To automatically signoff on every commit, copy the `community/dco-signoff-hook/prepare-commit-msg` file to the `.git/hooks` directory in your repo or if you already have such a hook, merge the contents into your existing hook.

## What is Keiko?

Keiko is a set of independent open source declarative tools for orchestration and management of multi-tenant, reliable, secure and efficient Kubernetes clusters in production.


## Why Keiko?
Keiko solves the following common problems faced when running and managing Kubernetes clusters at scale and at all stages of their lifecycle.

* How do I bootstrap and manage worker nodes for my cluster?
* How do I mitigate spurious pod/node failures as well as maintain SLAs and compliance?
* How do I manage critical cluster services required across all apps on clusters?
* How do I optimize cost of my cluster?
* How do I do forensic dumps?
